## FAQ ‚ùì 

### Is this an official TradingView extension?
No, OptiPie TradingView Optimizer Extension has no affiliation with TradingView. Read more at [Disclaimer](#disclaimer)

### Is it safe to use extension?
There hasn't been any reported account suspension happened yet but always [Use at Your Own Risk Disclaimer](#use-at-your-own-risk-disclaimer)

### Why Step Size doesn't work as expected?
OptiPie Step Size should always match Pinescript Step Size for the given input 'X'.
See [How to match different OptiPie Step Size?](https://github.com/OptiPie/tradingview-optimizer-extension/issues/24)

### Why clicking Optimize button pops up error message on a different page?
Make sure that TradingView tab and Strategy Settings window is opened before starting optimization.

### Why Optimization does not start even though I filled all parameter inputs?
Input 'Start' value always has to be less than 'End' value and for Step Size value use '.'(dot) decimal separator.

### What happens If I interrupt/close Strategy Settings Window or close TradingView tab?
Refresh the page and start optimization again. Do not interfere with any Strategy Settings Window component during optimization process.

### Can I start multiple optimizations in new tabs?
Yes, you can safely start new optimizations in new tabs or safely use your browser as usual.

### How do I know Optimization is done?
Success notification will popup whenever Optimization is completed.

### There are no notifications showing up when Optimization is done or when error occurs?
Please check your system allowed Chrome to send notifications and also check Chrome notification settings allowed 'Tradingview.com' to send notifications.

### There are some missing Strategy Results for some parameters, what should I do?
Sometimes TradingView Strategy Tester Overview window can not be loaded or loaded very slowly due to connection speed or TradingView hence some strategy test results may miss for bigger optimizations. 
If this happens too often, please refresh the page and make sure your internet connection is stable. 


## Application Design Overview

### Dependencies

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Bootstrap Table](https://bootstrap-table.com/), [JQuery](https://jquery.com/). 

All the dependencies are placed under `libs` folder. 


### UI

Application UI consists of `popup.html` and `reportdetail.html` files. 

`popup.html` is the main html that user interacts with and also Chrome Manifest requires as default popup. 

`reportdetail.html` is to show detailed optimization report in a new tab and can be only accessed through `popup.html`

### Backend

Application logic starts with `popup.js` which is bounded to `popup.html`. When everything is set, clicking Optimize button calls `chrome.scripting.executeScript` which executes `injector.js` file. This injects application business flow `script.js` file into TradingView.com source and behaves as a middle controller layer between `popup.js` and `script.js`. `background.js` file manages the chrome messages and other kinds of chrome event handlers. Finally, `reportdetail.js` is also bounded to `reportdetail.html` to serve data in UI. 

### Storage 

Every successful optimization report is saved to `chrome.storage.local` with 'report-data-' + 'strategyId' format. 

User Parameter Input values are also stored in `chrome.storage.local` for Chrome Session period. Starting new Chrome session will refresh the values.
